If checked, the build directory will be deleted before CMake invokation, <b>unless</b>
the <a href="#CmakeBuilder.sourceDir">source directory</a> and the 
<a href="#CmakeBuilder.buildDir">build directory</a> (above) are equal
(Because deleting the sources and then starting a build will definitely fail).
