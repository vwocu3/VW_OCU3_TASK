Common values are &lt;empty>, <kbd>Debug</kbd>, <kbd>Release</kbd>, <kbd>RelWithDebInfo</kbd>
and <kbd>MinSizeRel</kbd>.<br/>
An empty value is usually used with multi-configuration generators such as Visual Studio.
The Debug/Release values are
usually used with single configuration generators such as Ninja or Unix Makefiles.
<p>
If the value is not empty, the CMake cache variable <code>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</code>
will pre-populated with the value before CMake invocation.   
</p>
<p>
If you desire to use a custom build type, you are able to do so. 
Any custom build type requires additional configuration in CMakeLists.txt.
Please see the <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/wikis/doc/cmake/Useful-Variables#LC1">CMake wiki</a>
for details on extending the default set of build types.
