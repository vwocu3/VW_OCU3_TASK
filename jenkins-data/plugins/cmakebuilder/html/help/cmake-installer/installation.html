<div>Select the version of the tools of the cmake suite to use.<br>
The default entry <i>InSearchPath</i> in the drop-down list refers to the executables of the CMake tool
suite that are installed as an OS-distribution package on the build node; which might be too out-dated
to satisfy your specific needs.
<br>
If you need a more recent or specific version of the CMake tool suite for your build, it is possible to
have it downloaded and installed on the build node on demand. Ask your friendly
Jenkins administrator to configure additional tool suites on the 
<a href="/jenkins/configureTools/#CMake" target="_blank">Global Tool Configuration</a> page.
